Thanks for your interest in contributing to those tutorials!

**How you can contribute:**

* Fixing my English grammar and usage, as I'm not a native speaker. If this something non-trivial, links/explanations of why your way is better are welcome.

* Fixing factual errors. If this is something non-trivial, prefer opening an issue over sending a PR.

**What contributions are unlikely to be accepted:**

* Non-trivial style changes. This can be hit-or-miss. Some things are written weirdly because I'm not a native speaker (or had a brain fart), and fixes for those are welcome, but most things are intentionally worded in a certain way.

**What contributions I don't want:**

* Entire new articles. If you think something is missing, file an issue or contact me in some other way.
