## Installing tools for C/C++ development - the tutorial

### What is this tutorial for?

* This tutorial explains how to install the *tools* needed to code in C/C++, but not *how* to code. You'll still need a generic book/tutorial on C/C++.

* This tutorial is primarly for Windows. Most parts can be used for other OSes too.

* We are going to install Clang (in MSYS2 CLANG64), Visual Studio Code, Clangd, LLDB-DAP, which I consider to be the best choice. I also explain [why I picked those specific tools](/articles/why_philosophy.md), and what are the alternatives.

### How to read this tutorial?

Follow the steps below **in order**.

If you're new to C/C++, don't binge-read everything at once. Practice writing small programs and read your C/C++ book between the chapters of this tutorial.
