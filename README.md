## Installing tools for C/C++ development - the tutorial

### What is this tutorial for?

* This tutorial explains how to install the *tools* needed to code in C/C++, but not *how* to code. You'll still need a generic book/tutorial on C/C++.

* This tutorial is primarly for Windows. Most parts can be used for other OSes too.

* We are going to install Clang (in MSYS2 CLANG64), Visual Studio Code, Clangd, LLDB-DAP, which I consider to be the best choice. I also explain [why I picked those specific tools](/why_philosophy.md), and what are the alternatives.

### How to read this tutorial?

Follow the steps below **in order**.

If you're new to C/C++, don't binge-read everything at once. Practice writing small programs and read your C/C++ book between the chapters of this tutorial.

### Basics:

* ### [Installing a toolchain](/installing_toolchain.md)

* ### [Installing and configuring VSC](/installing_vsc.md)

### Debugging:

* ### [Debugging in a terminal](/debugging_in_terminal.md)

* ### [Debugging in VSC](/configuring_vsc_debugger.md)

### Additional information:

(You can read those in any order.)

* ### [Recommended compiler settings](/recommended_compiler_flags.md)

* ### [Using third-party libraries](/using_libraries.md)
