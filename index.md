This tutorial explains how to install the *tools* you need to code in C/C++, but not *how* to code. We are going to install Clang (in MSYS2 CLANG64), Visual Studio Code, Clangd, LLDB-DAP. I also explain why I recommend those specific tools, and what are the alternatives.

Follow the steps below **in order**.

If you're new to C/C++, don't binge-read everything at once. Practice writing small programs and read your C/C++ book between the chapters of this tutorial.
