This tutorial explains how to install the *tools* you need to code in C/C++, but not *how* to code. We are going to install MSYS2 Clang, Visual Studio Code, Clangd, LLDB-DAP. I also explain why I recommend those specific tools, and what are the alternatives.

Follow the steps below **in order**.

### Basic setup:

* ### [Installing a toolchain](/installing_toolchain.md)

* ### [Installing and configuring an IDE](/installing_ide.md)

### Debugging:

* ### [Debugging in a terminal](/debugging_in_terminal.md)

* ### [Debugging in VSC](/configuring_vsc_debugger.md)
