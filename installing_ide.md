# Installing an IDE

## What is an IDE?

**"IDE"** stands for "integrated development environment". It is a text editor (like Notepad or Word) with additional features useful for programming. "Integrated" means it *combines* together various features.

Some of the popular IDEs are: Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio (don't confuse the two!), CLion, Xcode, etc.

We will be installing Visual Studio Code (aka "VSC" or "VSCode"). *([Why not Visual Studio?](/why_not_visual_studio.md))*

## Installing and configuring Visual Studio Code


* Download the installer from https://code.visualstudio.com/ and install.<br/>
  Don't install any extensions VSC suggests to you yet, we'll get to that later.

Follow those steps in order:

* [Learn how to work in the VSC terminal.](/working_in_vscode_terminal_win.md)

* [Configure code completion.](/configuring_code_completion_win.md)

* [Configure hotkeys and buttons for compilation.](/configuring_vsc_tasks.md)
