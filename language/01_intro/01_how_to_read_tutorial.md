# How to read this tutorial?

## 1. Make sure you understand the words

If you stumble upon some term (or any word) I used that you don't understand, look it up. You can't understand the text if you don't understand the individual words.

## 2. Practice

Right after learning anything new, write a short program that uses the new thing that you just learned. Make sure you understand the concepts you learned enough to actually use them.

If you binge-read this tutorial without practicing, you will not learn anything.

On a related note, consider **not copy-pasting the examples** from the tutorial. Instead type them by hand to get used to it. (But do paste the very first test program to make sure all tools you will have installed are working correctly.)

## 3. Question everything

There's a lot of incorrect information out there. Question everything, no matter what authority figure says it, even if it's this very tutorial. Test the claims you hear and form your own opinions.

In particular, if this tutorial says that a certain program does something, don't blindly trust what I say. Go ahead and test it yourself.
