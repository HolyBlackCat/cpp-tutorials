# How to read this tutorial?

## 1. Make sure you understand the words

If you stumble upon some term (or any word) I used that you don't understand, look it up. You can't understand the text if you don't understand the individual words.

## 2. Practice

Right after learning anything new, write a short program that uses the new thing that you just learned. Make sure you understand the concepts you learned enough to actually use them.

If you binge-read this tutorial without practicing, you will not learn anything.

I provide **exercises** in some chapters. Do them if you want, but practice on your own too regardless. If you want to do the exercises, do them immediately when you get them. Don't continue reading until you manage to do them.

Don't feel the need to memorize everything you read. You'll naturally remember the parts that are useful by practicing.

On a related note, consider **not copy-pasting the examples** from the tutorial. Instead type them by hand to get used to it. (But do paste the very first test program to make sure all tools you will have installed are working correctly.)

## 3. Question everything

There's a lot of incorrect information out there. Question everything, no matter what authority figure says it, even if it's this very tutorial. Test the claims you hear and form your own opinions.

In particular, if this tutorial says that a certain program does something, don't blindly trust what I say. Go ahead and test it yourself.

## 4. Getting help

I recommend **not** asking AI to solve problems for you. Prefer googling and talking with real people.

And even when talking to people, don't accept solutions to exercises without any explanations. It's better if you're given hints and gradually arrive at the solution yourself.
