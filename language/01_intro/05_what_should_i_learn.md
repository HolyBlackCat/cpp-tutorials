# Should I learn C++?

What programming language to choose depends on what you want to create.

C++ is a good choice if you want to make games or other apps. It's a bad choice if you want to create websites.

C++ can be used in embedded systems (various devices with little computers in them, from fitness trackers to ATMs to cars).

If you have something else in mind, google it and see if C++ is the right choice for **you** or not.

### How does C++ compare to other languages?

Programs written in C++ work fast, but take more time to create than those in simpler languages.

C++ is said to be a "low level" language (at least compared to most other popular languages). This means it gives you control of the minute details of how *exactly* your program works, which has great learning value and lets you write faster programs, at the cost of taking more effort to write.

### Is C++ hard?

Harder than most other popular languages, yes. But not *that* hard. And the fact that it is scary means you'll have less competition.

### Should I learn C++ to get "good fundamentals" for another language?

Maybe. If you do this, set a goal for yourself to actually create something in C++. Leisurely reading about C++ while not planning to ever do anything in it is a waste of time.
