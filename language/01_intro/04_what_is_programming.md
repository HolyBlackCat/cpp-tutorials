# What is programming?

Programming is a process of making programs.

You've probably seen a lot of different programs:

* Games
* Editors (graphic editors such as Paint, text editors such as MS Word)
* Browsers (such as Chrome)
* Calendars, calculators, and so on.

By learning programming you will be able to create your own.

## Programming languages

The main part of programming is *writing* the programs (writing "code"). You do so in one of the *programming languages*. Programming also includes testing programs and fixing bugs, planning what exactly you need to write, and so on.

We need special invented languages (as opposed to natural ones like English) because the natural languages are hard for a computer to understand (modern AI chatbots are unreliable at best, and need a lot of computing power to run), and have ambiguities that make it hard to express what exactly you want the computer to do.

There are many programming languages to choose from, C++ being one of them.
