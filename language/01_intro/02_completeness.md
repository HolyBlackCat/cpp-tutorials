## Does this tutorial explain everything about C++?

No!

C++ is huge, and probably no one knows all of it anymore. You don't need to.

It's not very useful to write a huge tutorial that tries to explain all of C++.

You should learn a minimal workable part of it, and then create useful programs with it. You will graudally learn the remaining features from different sources, as you interact with other programmers and read code written by others.
