# C vs C++

You might've heard of the C language. C and C++ are two different languages.

C++ includes most of C in it. You can think of it as C with way more features. (Only a few small C features were removed from C++.)

C is a predecessor of C++. While C still exists today, there's little reason to use it, because C++ exists and provides more features.

You also might've heard of C#. While similar in name, it has nothing to do with C or C++, and is more similar to Java.

### Should I learn C before C++?

Maybe. Ultimately it doesn't matter, because you'll need to learn most of it sooner or later, because it's an important fundamental part of C++.

Most people today recommend starting directly with C++, but if starting with C feels better to you, do that.

What you definitely don't need is the stone age programming style that comes from writing C exclusively for years. C usually only makes sense as a stepping stone towards C++.
