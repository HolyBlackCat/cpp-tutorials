# C vs C++

You might've heard of the C language. C and C++ are two different languages.

C++ includes most of C in it. You can think of it as C with way more features.
Only a few small C features were removed from C++.

C is a predecessor of C++. While C still exists today, it is used for different
things than C++.

You also might've heard of C#. While similar in name, it has nothing to do with
C or C++, and is more similar to Java.

### Should I learn C before C++?

Maybe. Ultimately it doesn't matter, because you'll need to learn most of it
sooner or later, because it's a fundamental part of C++.

Most people today recommend starting directly with C++, as idiomatic C style
doesn't translate well into C++.
