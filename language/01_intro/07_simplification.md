# Simplifying things

And lastly, before we begin...

The annoying part about teaching C++ is that it's hard to give explanations that are both simple and correct, because some parts of C++ are quite complex.

You either go for simplicity and teach things "wrong", or go for correctness and create an unreadable mess.

The only solution I see is giving simplified explanations first, **mentioning that they are simplified**, and then revisiting them in later chapters to clean things up.
