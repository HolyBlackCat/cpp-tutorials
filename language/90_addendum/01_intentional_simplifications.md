# Intentional simplifications

This is the list of the things this tutorial intentionally simplifies or explains "wrong" at first, often to clarify in later chapters. See [intro/simplification](../01_intro/07_simplification.md).

This is here to satisfy advanced readers, and to assure them those simplifications aren't there by mistake.

Things we intentionally simplify at first:

* The exact definitions and nature of "expression", "object", "variable", etc.

* All the numerious initialization syntaxes.

* Avoiding the phrase "undefined behavior" in the array chapter. It is quickly introduced after that.

* Avoiding the words "syntax", "semantics", etc in the beginner chapters. They require a lengthy explanation, and would be confusing if used without an explanation.

* Avoiding the phrase "ill-formed" in the beginner chapters, for the same reason.

* So instead of saying "ill-formed" or even "syntax error", I'm saying "compilation error" in the beginner chapters. Yes, I know that compilers are not required to emit errors, and any diagnostic is allowed.
