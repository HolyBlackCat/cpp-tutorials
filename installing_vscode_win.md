# Installing and configuring VSCode (on Windows)





## Configuring code completion

### What is code completion?

"Code completion" (or "IntelliSense" as Microsoft calls it in their products) is a feature of most IDEs. It provides suggestions as you type, and shows most errors immediately without having to compile.

You don't *have* to use it, and writing a few simple programs without code completion is a good learning experience. But for more complex projects it's invaluable.

### What is Clangd?

Don't confuse Clangd and Clang. Clangd is a program you can install, that provides code completion for C and C++. It is based on Clang the compiler, hence the name.

TODO...

is an extension for VSC (aka a "plugin", something you can install to add new features to a program) that provides code completion for C and C++.
