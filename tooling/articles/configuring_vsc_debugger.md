# How to use a debugger in VSC?

[You should already know how to use a debugger in a terminal.](/tooling/articles/debugging_in_terminal.md)

This isn't very convenient, but there's a nicer way of using it in VSC.

## Checking PATH settings

Make sure you can run `lldb --version` in the VSC terminal. If you see `lldb : The term 'lldb' is not recognized...`, make sure you [have LLDB installed](/tooling/articles/debugging_in_terminal.md), and [have PATH configured correctly](/tooling/articles/working_in_vscode_terminal.md).

## Installing LLDB-DAP

There are several different extensions for debugging C/C++ in VSC:

* [**LLDB-DAP**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.lldb-dap)

* [**CodeLLDB**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb)

* [**Native Debug**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webfreak.debug)

* [**Microsoft's C/C++ extension**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)

We'll be using LLDB-DAP. *([Why LLDB-DAP?](/tooling/articles/why_lldb_dap.md))*

LLDB-DAP is relatively new, so if you get any issues with it, you can try CodeLLDB or any other extension in this list (I listed them roughly in my order of preference).

Like [Clangd](/tooling/articles/configuring_code_completion.md#installing-clangd), LLDB-DAP consists of two parts:

* A plugin for your IDE (for VSC in this case).

  Search for `lldb-dap` in the extension marketplace and install it:<br/>
  [![lldb-dap extension icon](/tooling/images/lldb_dap_extension_icon.png)]((/tooling/images/lldb_dap_extension_icon.png))

* A program called `lldb-dap` that the extension interacts with. You already have it installed because you [installed LLDB](/tooling/articles/debugging_in_terminal.md). But you need to tell the extension where to find it.

  **Open the settings (`File`→`Preferences`→`Settings`), search for `lldb dap executable` and type `C:\msys64\clang64\bin\lldb-dap.exe` in there.**

## Making sure the compilaton settings are correct

Make your compiler flags (in `tasks.json`) include `-g`, [as was explained before](/tooling/articles/debugging_in_terminal.md). Make sure to recompile the executable after adding it.

## Configuring the debugger

Make sure you have a folder opened in VSC. Use `File`→`Open Folder...`.

Open the `Run and Debug` tab by pressing the button on the left:<br/>
![run and debug icon](/tooling/images/vsc_debugging_icon.png)

Click `create a launch.json file`, and select `LLDB DAP Debugger`. It will create a file called `launch.json` in the `.vscode` directory in the current directory. This file holds debugging configurations. You can create it manually once you get used to it.

If you already have this file, delete it and try again.

If you see a window like this pop up, just close it by clicking anywhere or by pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd>:

![unwanted launch.json popup](/tooling/images/vsc_debugger_config_selection_unwanted.png)

The resulting file should look like this:

[![generated launch.json](/tooling/images/generated_launch_json.png)](/tooling/images/generated_launch_json.png)

If it for some reason doesn't look like this (if `"configurations": []` is empty), try deleting the file, doing this again, and this time selecting `LLDB: Launch` in the window above instead of dismissing that window.

Replace `<your program>` with the name of your program, e.g. `"program": "${workspaceRoot}/prog.exe"`. (Here `${workspaceRoot}` means the currently opened directory.)

Now pressing <kbd>F5</kbd> or the green 'play' button to start the debugger. [Like before](/tooling/articles/debugging_in_terminal.md), you should see your application window flash for a moment, and close immediately.

If nothing happens, you likely didn't configure LLDB-DAP [as was explained above](#installing-lldb-dap).

The output of your program should be visible in the `Debug Console` at the bottom of the screen (enable it in `View`→`Debug Console` if it's hidden).

## Using the debugger

The experience is similar to [what you had in the terminal](/tooling/articles/debugging_in_terminal.md).

Place a breakpoint by clicking to the left of a line number:

[![placing breakpoint](/tooling/images/vsc_breakpoint.png)](/tooling/images/vsc_breakpoint.png)

When you start the application and it gets paused on a breakpoint, you'll see the current line in yellow:

[![placing breakpoint](/tooling/images/vsc_paused_on_breakpoint.png)](/tooling/images/vsc_paused_on_breakpoint.png)

Control the debugger using the panel on the top:

[![debugger controls](/tooling/images/vsc_debugger_controls.png)](/tooling/images/vsc_debugger_controls.png)

View the variable values on the left panel, or just by moving the mouse over them in the code.

In the `Debug Console`, you can use [any commands you have learned before](/tooling/articles/debugging_in_terminal.md), such as `p` to print the values of variables. Or type variable names directly to print them.

Most of the things you see in the UI correspond to the [debugger commands](/tooling/articles/debugging_in_terminal.md) you've already learned:

[![debugger layout](/tooling/images/vsc_debugger_layout.png)](/tooling/images/vsc_debugger_layout.png)

## Automatically rebuilding the program before debugging

Right now, you need to manually compile the program (in the terminal, or with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>B</kbd>) after every change to the code, before starting the debugger (by pressing <kbd>F5</kbd> or the green arrow).

This can be automated. After the `"cwd": ...` line in `tasks.json`, add `"preLaunchTask": "Compile"` (where `Compile` is the task name that you specified in `tasks.json` as described [here](/tooling/articles/configuring_vsc_tasks.md)).

Now pressing <kbd>F5</kbd> or the green arrow will automatically recompile the program before starting the debugger.

### Handling compilation errors

You'll notice that if you press "Debug" while having errors in your code, VSC will show this:

[![debug anyway?](/tooling/images/vsc_debug_anyway.png)](/tooling/images/vsc_debug_anyway.png)

What you **shouldn't** do is pressing `Debug Anyway`. This will run the older version of your program, from the last time it compiled successfully.

Instead you should press `Abort`, fix your errors and try again (and perhaps enable the `Remember my choice ...` checkbox too).

Here `Show Errors` is is a bit misleading, since in our case it'll show Clangd errors, not compilation errors (which can be different in some cases). So I instead recommend pressing `Abort`.

In any case, if you botched this choice and enabled the checkbox too (so the window never appears again), you can fix this by going in the settings and changing `Debug: On Task Errors` (preferably to `Abort`).

## Debugging programs that accept input

As previously said [here](/tooling/articles/debugging_in_terminal.md#debugging-programs-that-accept-input), at the time of writing, LLDB seems to have issues with programs that accept input (via `std::cin` or similar) on Windows.

I couldn't find a way to make it work with LLDB-DAP. If it doesn't work for you too, you can either temporarily change the program to not accept input (use constant inputs), or switch to a different VSC extension.

CodeLLDB seems to work fine with input. Switching to CodeLLDB is simple: install the extension, and recreate `launch.json`, this time choosing `LLDB` instead of `LLDB-DAP`. It should result in exactly the same `launch.json` [as shown above](#configuring-the-debugger), but with `"type": "lldb"` instead of `"type": "lldb-dap`, and without `"env": []`. If you switch to CodeLLDB, the [next section](#improving-lldb-experience) doesn't apply to you.

## Improving LLDB experience

### Not debugging on compilation errors

### Extra settings

LLDB-DAP also has a few extra settings you can add to `launch.json`:

* **Open `Debug Console` automatically when starting the debugger:**
  ```json
  "internalConsoleOptions": "openOnSessionStart",
  ```

* **Improve how complex values are displayed:**
  ```json
  "enableAutoVariableSummaries": true,
  ```
  Let's say you have a struct: (if you don't know what those are, read your C++ book more and come back later)
  ```cpp
  struct A
  {
      int x, y;
  };

  A a = {10, 20};
  ```
  By default it's displayed this way:

  [![no auto variable summary in lldb](/tooling/images/lldb_no_auto_var_summaries.png)](/tooling/images/lldb_no_auto_var_summaries.png)

  To view the values of `x` and `y`, you'd have to press `>` on the left.

  But with this setting enabled, it will be displayed like this:

  [![auto variable summary in lldb](/tooling/images/lldb_auto_var_summaries.png)](/tooling/images/lldb_auto_var_summaries.png)

* **Allow inspecting true members of standard classes:**
  ```json
  "enableSyntheticChildDebugging": true
  ```
  Let's say you have a vector: (if you don't know what those are, read your C++ book more and come back later)
  ```cpp
  std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3};
  ```
  By default it's displayed like this:

  [![no synthetic child](/tooling/images/lldb_no_synth_child.png)](/tooling/images/lldb_no_synth_child.png)

  The elements are shown, but the internal implementation details of `std::vector` aren't shown. Sometimes they can be useful.

  With this setting enabled, you'll see this instead:

  [![no synthetic child](/tooling/images/lldb_synth_child.png)](/tooling/images/lldb_synth_child.png)

  In addition to the elements, this now shows the internals of `std::vector` too.

  By default the `[raw]` section is collapsed, so this isn't too obtrusive.
