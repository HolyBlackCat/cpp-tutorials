# How do disable AI tools in VSCode?

This is up to you, but I recommend disabling the AI tooling that VSCode now has enabled by default.

It can be harmful while learning, and arguably isn't much useful for real work too. (Not to mention it being annoying by showing up lots of places in VSC by default.)

* Go to `File`→`Preferences`→`Settings`.
* Type `disable ai` into the search bar,
* Enable the `Chat: Disable AI Features` checkbox.
