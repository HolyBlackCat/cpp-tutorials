# Variant: Clang in MSYS2 MINGW64

This is a small modification to the tutorial you're about to read.

You will install Clang in MSYS2 MINGW64, which is a more GCC-centric environment, instead of MSYS2 CLANG64.

Do the following during the tutorial:

* Any time the tutorial mentions `MSYS2 CLANG64` in any context, use `MSYS2 MINGW64` instead.

* Any time the tutorial mentions the `C:\msys64\clang64` directory, use `C:\msys64\mingw64` instead.

* Any time the tutorial mentions `mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-...` (in `pacman` commands), use `mingw-w64-x86_64-...` instead.
